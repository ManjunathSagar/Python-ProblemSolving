Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems that can create new content—such as text, images, audio, video, or even code—based on patterns learned from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on analyzing or predicting, generative AI is about producing original outputs that resemble human-created content.
Key Characteristics

Uses machine learning models (often deep learning) to learn patterns from large datasets.
Generates new data rather than just classifying or predicting.
Often powered by transformer-based architectures like GPT (for text) or diffusion models (for images).

Examples

Text generation: Chatbots, content creation tools (e.g., GPT models).
Image generation: Tools like DALL·E or Midjourney.
Audio & music: AI that composes songs or generates voices.
Code generation: AI that writes or optimizes programming code.

Types of Generative Models 
LLM
Vision Models
Audio and Speech models
Multi models
Agentic AI systems

How It Works
Generative AI models typically use techniques like:

Java developers : Code generations, Code refactoring, API development using GenAI, GenAI in springboot application, AI based unit test generation. 
ETL developers: Data cleaning automation, Intelligent data classification, PII detection, Query generation(SQL/Big Query/Sqnoflake), Metadata enrichment, Automated documentation.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two neural networks (generator and discriminator) compete to create realistic outputs.
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Encode and decode data to generate variations.
Transformers: Predict next tokens in sequences, enabling coherent text or structured outputs.

Evolution from ML → DL → Transformers → GenAI

ML Era: Algorithms like decision trees, SVMs, and regression dominated. Focus was on prediction and classification.
DL Era: Neural networks became deeper (CNNs for vision, RNNs for sequences). Enabled breakthroughs in speech and image recognition.
Transformer Era (2017 onward): Introduced by Attention Is All You Need. Transformers revolutionized NLP by enabling large-scale language models (e.g., GPT, BERT).
Generative AI Era: Leveraging transformers and diffusion models for creative tasks—text generation (ChatGPT), image generation (DALL·E), video, and multimodal AI.

What are tokens?

Tokens are the basic units of text that a model processes. They can be words, subwords, or even characters depending on the tokenizer.
Example:

Sentence: “Generative AI is amazing.”
Tokens: ["Gener", "ative", " AI", " is", " amazing", "."] (subword tokens)





Why tokens matter?

Models don’t understand raw text; they understand numerical representations of tokens.
Tokenization breaks text into manageable pieces for the model.



Token Limit

Every model has a context window (e.g., GPT-4 has ~128k tokens). This limits how much text it can process at once.


Embeddings


What are embeddings?

Embeddings are vector representations of tokens in a high-dimensional space.
Each token is mapped to a numeric vector (e.g., 768 or 1024 dimensions) that captures semantic meaning.



Why embeddings matter?

They allow the model to understand relationships between words.
Similar words have embeddings that are close in this vector space.
Example: “king” and “queen” will have embeddings that are closer than “king” and “car”.



How they are used in GenAI?

Input tokens >>> converted to embeddings >>> processed by transformer layers >>> output embeddings >>> decoded back into text.




Workflow in GenAI

Text Input >>> Tokenization >>> Tokens
Tokens >>> Embeddings (vectors)
Transformer layers process embeddings using attention
Generate new embeddings >>> Convert back to tokens >>> Output text
