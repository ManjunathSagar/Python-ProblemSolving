    "# Interview Notes: LangChain Agent Types for GenAI Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Agents\n",
    "Agents are autonomous systems that use LLMs to determine which actions to take and in what order. They maintain a reasoning loop: observe → think → act → repeat until task completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Components:**\n",
    "- **Agent:** The decision-making LLM that chooses actions\n",
    "- **Tools:** Functions the agent can call (APIs, databases, search engines)\n",
    "- **AgentExecutor:** Orchestrates the agent-tool interaction loop\n",
    "- **Memory:** Stores conversation history and context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. ZeroShotAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Is\n",
    "A versatile agent that selects tools based on their descriptions alone, without examples. It dynamically decides which tool to use for each step based on the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Uses the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** framework\n",
    "- Works with any tool, as long as it has a clear description\n",
    "- No fine-tuning or few-shot examples required\n",
    "- Single-turn action selection per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "{tool_descriptions}\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this format:\n",
    "Question: the input question\n",
    "Thought: reasoning about what to do\n",
    "Action: the tool to use\n",
    "Action Input: the input to the tool\n",
    "Observation: the result from the tool\n",
    "... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation as needed)\n",
    "Thought: I now know the final answer\n",
    "Final Answer: the final response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "- Quick prototyping with new tools\n",

    "### Example Tool Input\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"action\": \"database_query\",\n",
    "  \"action_input\": {\n",
    "    \"query\": \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25\",\n",
    "    \"database\": \"production\",\n",
    "    \"timeout\": 30,\n",
    "    \"return_format\": \"json\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",

    "## 4. ReAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### What It Is\n",
    "The foundational agent implementing the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigm** from the DeepMind paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "Combines verbal reasoning traces with actions:\n",
    "1. **Thought:** Internal reasoning step\n",
    "2. **Action:** External action via tool\n",
    "3. **Observation:** Result from action\n",
    "4. Repeat until final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReAct Framework Benefits\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** Reasoning is visible\n",
    "- **Debuggability:** Can trace decision path\n",
    "- **Error recovery:** Can self-correct based on observations\n",
    "- **Synergy:** Reasoning improves actions, actions ground reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Trace\n",
    "```\n",
    "Question: What's the weather in Paris and should I bring an umbrella?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: I need current weather data for Paris\n",
    "Action: weather_api\n",
    "Action Input: Paris, France\n",
    "Observation: Temperature 18°C, rain expected this afternoon\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: Rain is forecasted, so an umbrella would be useful\n",
    "Final Answer: The weather in Paris is 18°C with rain expected this afternoon. Yes, you should bring an umbrella.\n",

    "                    \"unit\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"]}\n",
    "                },\n",
    "                \"required\": [\"location\"]\n",
    "            }\n",

    "## Common Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When would you choose StructuredChatAgent over OpenAI Tools Agent?**\n",
    "A: StructuredChatAgent when using models without native function calling or when you need more control over the prompting strategy. OpenAI Tools Agent for production reliability with supported models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do you prevent agent hallucinations with tools?**\n",
    "A: Clear tool descriptions, output validation, structured outputs, setting max iterations, and using models with function calling support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How would you optimize agent performance in production?**\n",
    "A: Caching tool results, minimizing prompt tokens, using parallel tool calls, implementing timeouts, monitoring tool reliability, and choosing appropriate models for cost-performance trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between ReAct and Chain-of-Thought?**\n",
    "A: Chain-of-Thought is pure reasoning without actions. ReAct interleaves reasoning with real-world actions via tools, allowing the agent to ground its thinking in observations."
