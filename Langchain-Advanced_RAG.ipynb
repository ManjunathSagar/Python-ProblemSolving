    "### What is Context Re-ranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Context re-ranking is the process of reordering retrieved documents or chunks based on how relevant they are to the user’s query after retrieval, not during retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why is it needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector similarity search retrieves chunks based on embedding similarity, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ May include semantically similar but irrelevant chunks\n",
    "+ Does not always understand user intent deeply\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to:\n",

    "+ Hallucinations\n",

    "+ Important chunks appearing too late in the prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How it works internally\n",

    "1. Retriever fetches top N chunks (e.g., top 20)\n",
    "2. A re-ranker model (LLM or cross-encoder) scores each chunk against the query\n",
    "3. Chunks are sorted again by relevance\n",
    "4. Only the top K high-quality chunks are passed to the LLM\n",
