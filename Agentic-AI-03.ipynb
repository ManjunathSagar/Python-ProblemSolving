      "Summary: Regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI). The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions worldwide, including for international organizations without direct enforcement power like the IEEE or the OECD.\n",
      "Since 2016, numerous AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Furthermore, organizations deploying AI have a central role to play in creating and implementing trustworthy AI, adhering to established principles, and taking accountability for mitigating risks. The European Union adopted in 2024 a common legal framework for AI with the AI Act.\n",

      "Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\n",
      "High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\n",
      "Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n",

    "# Multi-Tool Agents - Study Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Multi-tool agents are AI systems that can use multiple tools/functions to accomplish complex tasks requiring sequential decision-making and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tool Selection (Decide Tool)\n",
    "**What it means:**\n",
    "- Agent must choose the appropriate tool from available options based on current context\n",
    "- Requires understanding of what each tool does and when to use it\n",
    "- Similar to a person deciding whether to use a calculator, search engine, or database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key considerations:**\n",
    "- Tool descriptions/specifications must be clear\n",
    "- Agent needs reasoning capability to match task requirements with tool capabilities\n",
    "- May involve scoring or ranking available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example flow:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"What's the weather in Paris and book me a flight there?\"\n",
    "→ Decides: Use weather API first, then flight booking API\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ReAct Loop (Reasoning + Acting)\n",
    "**Core concept:**\n",
    "- **Re**asoning + **Act**ing pattern\n",
    "- Iterative process where agent alternates between thinking and doing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loop structure:**\n",
    "1. **Thought**: Agent reasons about what to do next\n",
    "2. **Action**: Agent executes a tool/function\n",
    "3. **Observation**: Agent receives result from action\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue until task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example ReAct trace:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thought: I need to find current temperature in London\n",
    "Action: call_weather_api(city=\"London\")\n",
    "Observation: Temperature is 15°C, cloudy\n",
    "Thought: Now I should compare this with Paris\n",
    "Action: call_weather_api(city=\"Paris\")\n",
    "Observation: Temperature is 18°C, sunny\n",
    "Thought: I have enough information to answer\n",
    "Final Answer: Paris is warmer at 18°C vs London's 15°C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Interpretable - can see agent's reasoning\n",
    "- Error correction - agent can adjust based on observations\n",
    "- Flexible - handles multi-step problems dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Planning + Execution\n",
    "**Two-phase approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planning Phase:**\n",
    "- Agent creates a plan/strategy before acting\n",
    "- Breaks down complex task into subtasks\n",
    "- Determines order of operations\n",
    "- May create a dependency graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Phase:**\n",
    "- Follows the plan step-by-step\n",
    "- Executes tools in planned sequence\n",
    "- May adapt plan based on results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of planning:**\n",
    "- **Static planning**: Create full plan upfront, then execute\n",
    "- **Dynamic planning**: Create high-level plan, refine as you go\n",
    "- **Hierarchical planning**: Plans at multiple levels of abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Task: \"Research competitors and create a comparison report\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PLAN:\n",
    "1. Search for top 3 competitors\n",
    "2. For each competitor: fetch website, extract key info\n",
    "3. Organize data into structured format\n",
    "4. Generate comparison table\n",
    "5. Write summary analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "EXECUTION:\n",
    "Step 1: web_search(\"top competitors in X industry\")\n",
    "Step 2a: fetch_website(competitor1_url)\n",
    "Step 2b: extract_info(webpage_content)\n",
    "... continues through plan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integration Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct vs Planning:**\n",
    "- ReAct: More flexible, discovers path as it goes\n",
    "- Planning: More efficient, thinks before acting\n",
    "- **Hybrid**: Plan high-level strategy, use ReAct for execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool orchestration:**\n",
    "- Sequential: Tools used one after another\n",
    "- Parallel: Multiple tools called simultaneously\n",
    "- Conditional: Tool choice depends on previous results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infinite loops**: Agent gets stuck repeating same actions\n",
    "2. **Tool misuse**: Selecting wrong tool for the task\n",
    "3. **Context management**: Keeping track of state across multiple steps\n",
    "4. **Error handling**: Dealing with failed tool calls gracefully\n",
    "5. **Token limits**: Long ReAct traces consume context window\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define clear stop conditions\n",
    "- Limit maximum number of iterations\n",
    "- Provide good tool descriptions\n",
    "- Include examples in prompts\n",
    "- Handle partial failures\n",
    "- Log reasoning traces for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer service bots (search knowledge base → draft response → send email)\n",
    "- Research assistants (search → fetch articles → summarize → synthesize)\n",
    "- Data analysis agents (query database → process data → create visualization)\n",
    "- Coding assistants (search docs → write code → test → debug)"

    "# Agent Limitations & Best Practices: Notes for GenAI Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Avoiding Infinite Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Agent Loops?\n",
    "Agent loops occur when an AI agent repeatedly executes the same actions without making progress toward completing a task, getting stuck in a cycle of unproductive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Causes\n",
    "- **Unclear termination conditions**: The agent doesn't know when to stop trying\n",
    "- **Failed tool calls**: Repeatedly attempting the same action that keeps failing\n",
    "- **Circular dependencies**: Task A requires Task B, which requires Task A\n",
    "- **Lack of progress tracking**: Agent can't detect it's not making headway\n",
    "- **Overconfident retries**: Assuming the next attempt will succeed without changing approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevention Strategies\n",
    "**Set explicit limits**: Define maximum iteration counts for any repeated action (e.g., max 3 retries for failed API calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implement progress checks**: Track what's been attempted and verify each action creates measurable progress toward the goal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use state management**: Maintain a clear record of completed steps, failed attempts, and current position in the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define clear exit conditions**: Specify both success conditions (task complete) and failure conditions (give up after X attempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add circuit breakers**: Detect when the same action repeats too many times and force a different approach or escalation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Example Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max_attempts = 3\n",
    "attempt_history = set()\n",
    "\n",
    "for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n",
    "    action_signature = generate_action_signature(current_state)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if action_signature in attempt_history:\n",
    "        # Detect we're repeating ourselves\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    \n",
    "    attempt_history.add(action_signature)\n",
    "    result = execute_action()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if is_successful(result):\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Tool Misuse\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Tool Misuse?\n",
    "Tool misuse occurs when an AI agent uses available tools incorrectly, inefficiently, or inappropriately for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Types of Misuse\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong tool for the job**: Using a web scraper when an API exists, using search when calculation is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excessive tool calls**: Making 50 API requests when 1 would suffice, repeatedly searching for information already obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ignoring tool outputs**: Calling a tool but not properly using the returned data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter errors**: Passing incorrect data types, malformed inputs, or ignoring required parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential when parallel possible**: Making dependent calls in sequence when they could run concurrently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not handling errors**: Failing to check if tool execution succeeded before proceeding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool selection logic**: Implement clear decision trees for which tool to use in which situation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validate before execution**: Check that inputs are appropriate before calling tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parse and verify outputs**: Always validate tool responses before using them in subsequent steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implement rate limiting**: Respect API limits and avoid overwhelming external services\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch operations**: Combine multiple similar requests into single calls when tools support it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error handling**: Wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks and have fallback strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Patterns\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Check if tool is appropriate first\n",
    "def get_weather(location):\n",
    "    if not is_valid_location(location):\n",
    "        return \"Invalid location provided\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = weather_api.call(location)\n",
    "        if result.status == 'success':\n",
    "            return parse_weather_data(result)\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return handle_weather_error(result)\n",
    "    except APIError as e:\n",
    "        return fallback_weather_source(location)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Hallucinated Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Hallucinated Tools?\n",
    "Tool hallucination occurs when an AI agent invents or references tools that don't actually exist in its available toolkit, leading to execution failures and confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "- **Training data confusion**: The model saw similar tools during training\n",
    "- **Wishful thinking**: The agent \"wants\" a tool that would solve the problem perfectly\n",
    "- **Incomplete tool awareness**: Not properly tracking which tools are actually available\n",
    "- **Name similarity**: Confusing `get_user_data()` with `fetch_user_info()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detection Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strict tool registry**: Maintain an explicit list of available tools and validate against it before execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema validation**: Verify tool calls match exact function signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution gatekeeping**: Have a validation layer that rejects calls to non-existent tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logging and monitoring**: Track attempted tool calls to identify hallucination patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevention Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clear tool documentation in prompts**: Provide the agent with an explicit, complete list of available tools with their exact names and parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured output formats**: Require tool calls to follow strict JSON schemas that can be validated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confirmation steps**: Before executing, have the agent confirm the tool exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fallback handling**: When a hallucinated tool is detected, prompt the agent to select from actual available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "AVAILABLE_TOOLS = {\n",
    "    'web_search': {'params': ['query'], 'required': ['query']},\n",
    "    'calculator': {'params': ['expression'], 'required': ['expression']},\n",
    "    'file_read': {'params': ['path'], 'required': ['path']}\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "def validate_tool_call(tool_name, params):\n",
    "    if tool_name not in AVAILABLE_TOOLS:\n",
    "        raise ToolNotFoundError(\n",
    "            f\"{tool_name} not available. \"\n",
    "            f\"Available tools: {list(AVAILABLE_TOOLS.keys())}\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    required = AVAILABLE_TOOLS[tool_name]['required']\n",
    "    if not all(param in params for param in required):\n",
    "        raise InvalidParametersError(\n",
    "            f\"Missing required parameters: {required}\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Best Practices for Agent Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning Before Acting\n",
    "- Encourage agents to create execution plans before starting\n",
    "- Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable subtasks\n",
    "- Validate plans against available tools and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observability\n",
    "- Log all tool calls with timestamps and parameters\n",
    "- Track decision-making process (why this tool was chosen)\n",
    "- Monitor execution time and resource usage\n",
    "- Create dashboards for agent behavior analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graceful Degradation\n",
    "- Design agents to fail gracefully when tools are unavailable\n",
    "- Provide partial results rather than complete failure\n",
    "- Communicate limitations clearly to users\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Strategies\n",
    "- Unit test individual tool integrations\n",
    "- Integration test tool combinations\n",
    "- Simulate tool failures to test error handling\n",
    "- Use diverse test cases including edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "- For critical operations, require human approval\n",
    "- Provide override mechanisms for agent decisions\n",
    "- Create escalation paths when agents are stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation Requirements\n",
    "- Document all available tools with examples\n",
    "- Maintain change logs when tools are updated\n",
    "- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues\n",
    "- Provide clear error messages that aid debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways for GenAI Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always assume things can go wrong**: Design for failure, not just success\n",
    "2. **Make the invisible visible**: Log, monitor, and instrument everything\n",
    "3. **Constrain creativity**: Sometimes limiting agent freedom prevents problems\n",
    "4. **Validate relentlessly**: Check inputs, outputs, and tool availability at every step\n",
    "5. **Learn from failures**: Analyze what went wrong and update your systems accordingly"
